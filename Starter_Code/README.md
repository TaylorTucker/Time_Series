Executive Summary


 Various time-series tools are tested to determin if they could be used to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.

 Tasks:

1. Time Series Forecasting
2. Linear Regression Modeling

#### Time-Series Forecasting

Analyzed historical Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data by applying time series analysis and modeling to determine whether there is any predictable behavior.

Steps in the time-series 

1. Decomposition using a Hodrick-Prescott Filter (Decompose the Settle price into trend and noise).

### Conclusion

Based on the time series analysis, it does not appear to be a good time to buy the YEN. Though, the price is projected to increase, the retures are projected to decrease.  Also, an increase in volatility is projected meaning there is a possibility of increased future risk.

With all models missing the (P < 0.05) qualifier, I would not feel confident in using these models for trading.

#### Linear Regression Forecasting

Built Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict Yen futures ("settle") returns with *lagged* Yen futures returns and categorical calendar seasonal effects (e.g., day-of-week or week-of-year seasonal effects).

Steps in the regression_analysis:

1. Data Preparation (Creating Returns and Lagged Returns and splitting the data into training and testing data)

4. Out-of-sample performance.

5. In-sample performance.

### Conclusion

 This model performs better on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data given the lower RMSE.

### Hints and Considerations

* Out-of-sample data is data that the model hasn't seen before (Testing data).
* In-sample data is data that the model was trained on (Training data).

### Submission

* Create Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis and host the notebooks on GitHub.

* Include a Markdown that summarizes your models and findings and include this report in your GitHub repo.

* Submit the link to your GitHub project to Bootcampspot.
